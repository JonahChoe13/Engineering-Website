    8/31/22
    Today I first went to school then went back to CV to practice volleyball with my friends who are also on the team. I also learned how to use TinkerCad to 3D design some things. It is a basic but useful website.<br>

    9/12/22
    Last week I had a great week at school with nothing going wrong except going down with a cold last weekend. It was super boring except being able to watch the NFL games. GO COMMANDERS!!<br>
    Week 1
    I got to go visit my classes and get to know my teachers more. I wasn't in this class yet because my schedule wasn't switch up to this point yet.<br>
    Week 2
    Still wasn't in this class, but in my other intro to engineering class I was able to learn about setting up my website and also got to put it online from github.<br>
    Week 3
    I have officially joined this class and we did our first challenge day. It was with half pipes and with much teamwork. Teamwork was needed to have the marble ride through the pipes and eventually reach the end of the track. I believe that the team I was on was the first team to have the marble reach the end and into the bucket/container. Mainly was just fixing our website throughout the week. It was a small week because of labor day, back to school night, and minimum day on friday. This week I learned how to keep on updating my website and be able to keep on updating this website to turn in for future points.<br> 
    Week 4
    Still on week 4.
